> Actually, https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/angular is the very valuable source of information about AngularJS.
>
> The official docs aren't always up to date, won't reflect both stable (1.0.x) and unstable (1.1.x) and don't contain so much examples (which you will notice after days/weeks).
>
> So, indeed: Using Google the right way is important because Google indices both Groups and Stackoverflow very, very deep. And sometimes, you should look just at https://github.com/angular/angular.js (including isssues and PRs)...

> I'm working with AngularJS since October last year when we'd ported our app in a bigger rework process.
>
> And: Don't forget Angular UI http://angular-ui.github.com/
